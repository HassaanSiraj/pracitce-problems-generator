# Write a method peak_finder(arr) that returns an array of indices of all
# "peaks" in the input array. A peak is an element strictly greater than its
# immediate neighbor(s). The first and last elements are peaks if they are
# greater than their single neighbor. Return indices in increasing order.
# Examples:
# peak_finder([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) => [2]
# peak_finder([1, 2, 3, 3, 2]) => [1]
# peak_finder([3, 2, 1]) => [0]
# peak_finder([1, 2, 3]) => [2]
def peak_finder(arr)
